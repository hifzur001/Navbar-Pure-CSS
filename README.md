# Navbar-Pure-CSS
A pure CSS navbar is a navigation bar that is created using only CSS, without the use of JavaScript or any other programming language. It typically consists of a horizontal bar that contains links to various sections of a website. The navbar is designed to be responsive and mobile-friendly, allowing it to adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.

To create a pure CSS navbar, you would typically use the "ul" and "li" HTML tags to create a list of links, and then use CSS to style and position the links within the navbar. You can also add hover and active states to the links to provide visual feedback to the user.

Some common CSS properties used in creating a pure CSS navbar include "display", "position", "margin", "padding", "background-color", "color", "font-size", and "text-align". By combining these properties in different ways, you can create a customized navbar that fits the design and functionality needs of your website.
